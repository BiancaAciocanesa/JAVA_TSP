# Java Project: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This Java project focuses on solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using two different algorithms: a **Genetic Algorithm** and **Christofides' Algorithm**, implemented from two separate libraries. The project processes datasets containing coordinate data for various locations and evaluates the efficiency of both approaches.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Handling:** Loads and processes coordinate datasets representing different TSP instances.
- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - **Genetic Algorithm:** Uses an evolutionary approach to approximate the optimal route.
  - **Christofides' Algorithm:** Utilizes a heuristic method for generating near-optimal solutions.
- **Performance Analysis:**
  - Computes the total route distance for each algorithm.
  - Measures execution time for each approach.
- **Report Generation:** Outputs results in **HTML format**, including:
  - Solution quality (total distance).
  - Execution time analysis.
  - Algorithm efficiency comparison.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developed in **Java Swing**, allowing users to:
  - Load datasets.
  - Select an algorithm for solving the problem.
  - View real-time results and statistics in a user-friendly format.

This project demonstrates the strengths and trade-offs of different TSP-solving techniques while providing an interactive and visually intuitive experience for users.
